# CipherSeive
A lightweight, from-scratch Java tool for sifting through saved passwords in bulk. 

It:
- Reads exported password files (CSV/JSON from browsers or managers).
- Analyzes strength with entropy checks, reuse detection, and n-gram rarity scoring.
- Flags weak or common entries.
- Outputs both machine-readable JSON and human-friendly Markdown summaries.
